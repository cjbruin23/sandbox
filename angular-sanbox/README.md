# Angular Sanbox

This project will house Angular best practices and different use cases for development and testing.

I started off using this link (<https://itnext.io/choosing-the-right-file-structure-for-angular-in-2020-and-beyond-a53a71f7eb05>) for best structural practices.

## Entry Point

The App component is the entry point for the application, and should contain routing and descriptions of all the other components and what they are trying to achieve.
